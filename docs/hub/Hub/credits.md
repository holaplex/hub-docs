# Credits

Hub operations are funded with credits.

Credits on Hub enable you to seamlessly perform all the actions you want without worrying about finer details like calculating the cost for each function youâ€™re trying to build. As blockchains & protocols differ wildly in the way they treat different gas and network fees, credits provide a unifying payment system to cover it all. 

Credits are applied at an **organization level**. Each new organization is granted 1,000 tokens to get started. View your organization's current credit balance at [hub.holaplex.com/credits/costs](https://hub.holaplex.com/credits/costs).

## Spending credits

The number of credits required to perform different Hub operations is based on current market prices. View the current cost of operations at [hub.holaplex.com/credits/costs](https://hub.holaplex.com/credits/costs).

Credits are currently required in order to:
- Create a drop
- Mint an NFT

Soon, credits will also be required in order to:
- Create a new customer wallet (wallets are automatically created upon customer creation)

If an action fails or is canceled, the corresponding Hub credits will be refunded to your organization.

## Purchasing credits

To purchase credits, click the **Buy more credit** button on your organization's [credits tab](https://hub.holaplex.com/credits/costs). You'll be taken to a Stripe checkout page where you can select the number of credits to purchase. Payments are currently accepted via credit card. Credits are immediately reflected in your organization's balance. 

We also offer subscription pricing. For more information, please contact [support@holaplex.com](mailto:support@holaplex.com).
